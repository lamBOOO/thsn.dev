    abstract: "In this study, we present a finite element solver for a thermodynamically consistent electrolyte model that accurately captures multicomponent ionic transport by incorporating key physical phenomena such as steric effects, solvation, and pressure coupling. The model is rooted in the principles of non-equilibrium thermodynamics and strictly enforces mass conservation, charge neutrality, and entropy production. It extends beyond classical frameworks like the Nernst-Planck system by employing modified partial mass balances, the electrostatic Poisson equation, and a momentum balance expressed in terms of electrostatic potential, atomic fractions, and pressure, thereby enhancing numerical stability and physical consistency. Implemented using the FEniCSx platform, the solver efficiently handles one- and two-dimensional problems with varied boundary conditions and demonstrates excellent convergence behavior and robustness. Validation against benchmark problems confirms its improved physical fidelity, particularly in regimes characterized by high ionic concentrations and strong electrochemical gradients. Simulation results reveal critical electrolyte phenomena, including electric double layer formation, rectification behavior, and the effects of solvation number, Debye length, and compressibility. The solver's modular variational formulation facilitates its extension to complex electrochemical systems involving multiple ionic species with asymmetric valences. ",

    abstract: "In this work, we explore the method of fundamental solutions (MFS) for solving the regularized 13-moment (R13) equations for rarefied monatomic gases. While previous applications of the MFS in rarefied gas flows relied on problem-specific fundamental solutions, we propose a generic approach that systematically computes the fundamental solutions for any linear moment system without predefined source terms. The generalized framework is first introduced using a simple example involving the Stokes equations, and is then extended to the R13 equations. The results obtained from the generic MFS are validated against an analytical solution for the R13 equations. Following validation, the framework is applied to the case of thermally-induced flow between two non-coaxial cylinders. Since no analytical solution exists for this case, we compare the results obtained from the MFS with those obtained from the finite element method (FEM). To further assess computational efficiency, we analyze the runtimes of the FEM and MFS. The results indicate that the MFS converges faster than the FEM and serves as a promising alternative to conventional meshing-based techniques.",

    abstract: "In this paper, we finally catch up with proving the well-posedness of the linearized R13 moment model, which describes, e.g., rarefied gas flows. As an extension of the classical fluid equations, moment models are robust and have been frequently used, yet they are challenging to analyze due to their additional equations. By effectively grouping variables, we identify a 2-by-2 block structure, allowing the analysis of the well-posedness within the abstract LBB framework of saddle point problems. Due to the unique tensorial structure of the equations, in addition to an interesting combination of tools from Stokes' and linear elasticity theory, we also need new coercivity estimates for tensor fields. These Korn-type inequalities are established by analyzing the symbol map of the symmetric and trace-free part of tensor derivative fields. Together with the corresponding right inverse of the tensorial divergence, we obtain the existence and uniqueness of weak solutions.",

    abstract: "Accelerating iterative eigenvalue algorithms is often achieved by employing a spectral shifting strategy. Unfortunately, improved shifting typically leads to a smaller eigenvalue for the resulting shifted operator, which in turn results in a high condition number of the underlying solution matrix, posing a major challenge for iterative linear solvers. This paper introduces a two-level domain decomposition preconditioner that addresses this issue for the linear Schrödinger eigenvalue problem, even in the presence of a vanishing eigenvalue gap in non-uniform, expanding domains. Since the quasi-optimal shift, which is already available as the solution to a spectral cell problem, is required for the eigenvalue solver, it is logical to also use its associated eigenfunction as a generator to construct a coarse space. We analyze the resulting two-level additive Schwarz preconditioner and obtain a condition number bound that is independent of the domain's anisotropy, despite the need for only one basis function per subdomain for the coarse solver. Several numerical examples are presented to illustrate its flexibility and efficiency.",

The quasi-optimality is achieved by having the iterative eigenvalue algorithms converge in a constant number of iterations for different domain sizes. In the analysis, we derive an analytic factorization of the spectrum and asymptotically describe it using concepts from the homogenization theory. This decomposition allows us to express the eigenpair as an easy-to-calculate cell problem solution combined with an asymptotically vanishing remainder. We then prove that the easy-to-calculate limit eigenvalue can be used in a shift-and-invert preconditioning strategy to bound the number of eigensolver iterations uniformly. Several numerical examples illustrate the effectiveness of this quasi-optimal preconditioning strategy.",

We describe a new tensorial approach utilizing the extension capabilities of FEniCS’ Unified Form Language to define required differential operators for tensors above second degree. The presented solver serves as an example for implementing tensorial variational formulations in FEniCS, for which the documentation and literature seem to be very sparse. Using the software abstraction levels provided by the Unified Form Language allows an almost one-to-one correspondence between the underlying mathematics and the resulting source code. Test cases support the correctness of the proposed method using validation with exact solutions. To justify the usage of extended gas flow models, we discuss typical application cases involving rarefaction effects. We provide the documented and validated solver publicly.",

We will take a mathematical approach to theoretical chemistry, covering topics such as electric charge interactions between molecular systems, the transition from classical to quantum mechanics, the Hartree-Fock model, and its breakdown. If time allows, we will also examine some aspects of Density Functional Theory (DFT). By the end of the course, students will have a deep understanding of the mathematical principles underlying computational chemistry and will be able to apply these principles to their own research in the field."

It also introduces the finite element method for elliptic problems and some modern iterative methods, such as PCG and multigrid method. The course then extends to parabolic problems and shows how to use the method of lines for their discretization. It also presents the finite volume method as another discretization technique. The course then deals with saddle point problems and their application to Stokes equations. Finally, it discusses the Navier-Stokes equation for incompressible fluids. The main goals of this course are to help students understand the basic principles of discretizing partial differential equations and to teach them how to use different numerical methods for solving them. The students will also learn how to evaluate the results of these methods and how to adapt them to new tasks. The students will acquire confidence in using discretization techniques such as finite elements and finite volume methods, as well as iterative solution methods such as PCG and multigrid method."
